- 👋 Hi, I’m @fmenkin (Frank)
- I retired in 2015 from years of consulting and programming and wrote a Fixed Income Budgeting program in SQLiteFlow 
- to help me budget and make informed decisions.
- 🌱 SQLiteFlow met my needs beautifully but appeared to lack a way to allow quick and easy entries into my "Category" field 
- that would perfectly match known category names.
- (See snippet of my trigger approach attached to my request.)
- For example, my trigger allows me to enter "con" into the "Category" field, 
- and the system substitutes "Contributions" when I hit the enter key twice.
- Note:
- My solution keeps things simple and works perfectly but slows too much when large numbers of records have been generated.
- 💞️ I’m looking for help because I don't know enough about SQLiteFlow capabilites to solve the speed problem in a simple way.
- 📫 Thanks for the quick follow-up!
